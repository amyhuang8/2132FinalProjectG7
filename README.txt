This is our group project for CSI2132B Databases I.
Included is our work to build a mock hotel system
through a website that operates on a server based on
a local Postgres database.

To create the database, create the schema named "ehotels".
Next, locate the text files found in folder "DatabaseProjectV3,"
and following the step number labelled in the file names,
open and copy-paste the contents of each .txt to your
Postgres console and run it.
