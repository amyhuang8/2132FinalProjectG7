This is our group project for CSI2132B Databases I.
Included is our work to build a mock hotel system
through a website that operates on a server based on
a local Postgres database.

To create the database, create the scheme named "ehotels". Next, locate the text files found in folder "DatabaseProjectV3" and following the step number labelled in the name, open, then copy and paste what is in each .txt to your Postgres console and run it.
